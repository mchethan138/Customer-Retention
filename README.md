üìä Customer Churn Analysis Dashboard
This project presents an end-to-end Customer Churn Analysis and Risk Profiling using Power BI. It is designed to help telecom or subscription-based service providers identify at-risk customers, analyze behavioral and demographic patterns, and take data-driven decisions to reduce churn and improve customer retention.

üìå Key Observations from the Churn Analysis Project
üìä Churn Dashboard
Demographics:

Gender distribution among churners is almost equal (Female: 49.76%, Male: 50.24%).

25% of churners are Senior Citizens, indicating higher risk in older age groups.

36% have partners, and 17% have dependents, which could impact service cancellation decisions.

Subscription Duration:

53% of churned customers were subscribed for less than 1 year, suggesting that new users are more likely to churn.

Churn rate significantly drops with longer subscription duration.

Payment Behavior:

A high percentage (57%) of churners used Electronic checks, indicating possible dissatisfaction or low customer stickiness among users of this method.

Month-to-month contracts dominate churners (89%), clearly showing customers prefer flexibility when leaving.

Billing Preference:

74.91% of churners had Paperless Billing, which might be correlated with digital-only customers who engage less.

Service Usage:

91% of churners had Phone Service.

44% used Streaming TV/Movies and 29% had Device Protection, showing higher churn among entertainment service users.

50% of churners had multiple lines, indicating that even multi-line users are not immune.

Support Issues:

High number of Tech (2,173) and Admin (885) support tickets may indicate poor service experiences contributing to churn.

Overall Churn Rate:

The churn rate stands at 42.71%, which is significantly high.

Churn by Internet Service:

Fiber Optic users have the highest churn rate (54.61%), despite it being a premium service. This may indicate issues with reliability or pricing.

DSL users have a moderate churn rate (32.22%).

Customers without internet service churn the least (18.89%).

Churn by Contract Type:

Customers on Month-to-Month contracts show much higher churn rates than those on annual or two-year contracts.

Churn by Payment Method:

Electronic Check users again show the highest churn rate among all payment types.

Customers using Bank Transfer, Credit Card, and Mailed Check have relatively lower churn rates.

Churn by Subscription Time:

Customers with less than 1 year of service have the highest churn rate.

The churn rate gradually decreases with time, indicating that customer loyalty improves with service duration.

Revenue Impact:

Monthly charges are highest among Fiber Optic users, which correlates with their high churn rate.

Total churned customer charges exceed 5.31M, showing a significant revenue loss due to churn.

‚úÖ Suggestions to Reduce Customer Churn
1. Target New Customers with Engagement Strategies
Observation: 53% of churners left within the first year.

Suggestion: Implement strong onboarding programs, early check-ins, and loyalty incentives within the first 6‚Äì12 months to increase retention.

2. Incentivize Long-Term Contracts
Observation: 89% of churned customers are on month-to-month contracts.

Suggestion: Offer discounts or bundled services for switching to 1- or 2-year contracts to lock in customers longer.

3. Review Issues with Electronic Check Payments
Observation: Highest churn rate is from customers using Electronic Checks.

Suggestion: Investigate usability or trust issues with this payment method and promote secure alternatives like credit card or bank transfer with rewards or easier processes.

4. Improve Service Quality for Fiber Optic Users
Observation: Fiber Optic users have the highest churn rate (54.61%).

Suggestion: Since this is a premium service, ensure performance reliability. Collect feedback and address pain points like speed consistency or pricing transparency.

5. Monitor Customers Logging Support Tickets
Observation: High number of admin (885) and tech (2,173) tickets.

Suggestion: Create a churn-risk flag for customers opening multiple tickets and provide proactive support or compensation (e.g., service credits, priority resolution).

6. Focus Retention on High-Value Customers
Observation: Monthly and total charges from churned users are high (TotalCharges: 5.31M).

Suggestion: Use a customer lifetime value model to identify and prioritize retention campaigns for high-paying customers.

7. Reevaluate Paperless Billing Communication
Observation: 74.91% churners use Paperless Billing.

Suggestion: Ensure digital communication (emails, bills) is clear and engaging, and use it as a channel to promote retention offers or satisfaction surveys.

8. Segment Customers by Service Use
Observation: Customers using Phone (91%), Streaming Movies (44%), and Device Protection (29%) have higher churn rates.

Suggestion: Run usage-based segmentation and evaluate if these services are adding perceived value. Consider bundling or upgrading features to improve satisfaction.

9. Promote Referral or Loyalty Programs
Observation: Customers with <1 year tenure are most at risk.

Suggestion: Introduce referral discounts, milestone rewards, or loyalty points to encourage new customers to stay longer.
